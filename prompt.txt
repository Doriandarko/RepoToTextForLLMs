What we gonna do for today:

Prompt: Analyze the ##REPO_NAME## repository to understand its structure, purpose, and functionality. Follow these steps to study the codebase:

1. Read the README file to gain an overview of the project, its goals, and any setup instructions.

2. Examine the repository structure to understand how the files and directories are organized.

3. Identify the main entry point of the application (e.g., main.py, app.py, index.js) and start analyzing the code flow from there.

4. Study the dependencies and libraries used in the project to understand the external tools and frameworks being utilized.

5. Analyze the core functionality of the project by examining the key modules, classes, and functions.

6. Look for any configuration files (e.g., config.py, .env) to understand how the project is configured and what settings are available.

7. Investigate any tests or test directories to see how the project ensures code quality and handles different scenarios.

8. Review any documentation or inline comments to gather insights into the codebase and its intended behavior.
